This directory contains a simplified version of the openssl 'x509'
command for signing certificate requests, enhanced with the ability to
set the DN on the signed certificates.

The files in this directory fall under the OpenSSL license. The the
file LICENSE for details.

These files are from the openssl-0.9.8d distribution. The files
app_rand.c, apps.c apps.h, and e_os.h are all taken from the
distribution with the only changes being to #ifdef out unneeded code
that cause problems with prior versions of openssl.

The file openssl-ca.c is a stripped down version of x509.c from the
openssl distribution, streamlined to just sign certificate requests
and with enhancements to allow the setting of the subject by the
caller.
