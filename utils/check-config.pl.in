=head1 check-config.pl

Check the GridShibCA configuration file F<gridshib-ca.conf> for errors.

=head2 Usage

Just run the script. It will display all parameters in the
configuration file in addition to any warnings or errors parsing the
file.

The script takes one optional argument, which is a path for a file to
use instead of the default configuration file.

=head2 Return Value

The return value of check-config.pl is zero on success, non-zero on
error.

=head2 Version

GridShib-CA version @PACKAGE_VERSION_STRING@ ($Id$)
