This directory contains files from the Globus CoG distribution. In
order to keep the size of our jar as small as possible we only have
the files here we need and then prune unneeded dependancies from those
files. Modifications are in the .diff files (currently on Util.java is
modified).

You can find the original (and latest source) at

or more specifically:
