This directory contains all the certificates that are trusted by the
JWS application to have signed the web server certificate from which
it retrieves the credential. These certificates are loaded into
resources/trustStore. Run "make trustStore" to create or update this
file.

To add a new certificate when doing a complete build, simply drop the
pem-encoded file into this directory. Make sure it has a name that
ends in a digit (e.g. 6349a761.0) and it will be automatically picked
up by the build.

To add a certificate to an existing jar file, please see the
directions in doc/https-cas.html
