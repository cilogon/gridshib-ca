# Authorized IdPs File
#
# This file lists all the Idps which are trusted by the GridShib CA to assert
# user identities.
#
# Each line starts with a string identifying a Idp, or using "*"
# globbing a set of IdPs. Following that string, separated by
# whitepace, a double-quote delimited string describing how the DN
# should be constructed for users from that IdP. This string can
# contain "${variable-name}" strings indicated environment variable
# names as set by the Shibboleth SP code. The result of the string
# should be a RFC 2253-style DN for the user to be prepended to the
# CA's relative DN. For example, the following string would set a OU
# component eequal to the IdP's id and then a CN equal to the user's
# ePPN:
# urn:mace:inqueue:*  "cn=${REMOTE_USER}, ou=${HTTP_SHIB_IDENTITY_PROVIDER}"
#
# Any line starting with a "#" is treated as a comment and ignored.
# A "*" matches any string.

# Any idp in InQueue. Use the IdP id as the OU component and ePPN as the CN
urn:mace:inqueue:* "cn=${REMOTE_USER}, ou=${HTTP_SHIB_IDENTITY_PROVIDER}"
