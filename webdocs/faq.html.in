<h2>Setting your Umask</h2>
<a name="whatis"><b>What is this umask thing?</b></a>
<p>
On Unix systems each file has a set of permissions that controls who
can read and write the file. The umask setting controls the
default permissions on new files that you (or applications you run)
create.
<p>
<a name="why"><b>Why does the GridShib CA care about the
		umask?</b></a>
<p>
When your web browser launches the Java Web Start file used by the
GridShib CA to download your credentials, the browser writes a file to
the temporary directory which is used by Java Web Start. This file
contains a secret value (detail: the Shibboleth session id) used by
the Java Web Start application. If your umask is set insecurely this
temporary file could be read by other users on your system and used to
impersonate you and get a copy of your Grid credential from the
GridShib CA.

<a name="unix"><b>Setting the umask under Unix</b></a>
<p>
Use the <i>umask</i> command to set the umask under windows, and then
launch your web browser from the same shell. For example:
<pre>
% umask 077
% netscape &
</pre>
You can also put the "umask 077" command into your ~/.cshrc file.
<p>
<a name="mac"><b>Setting the umask under the Mac OS X GUI</b></a>
<p>
While you can use the same method for setting the umask as described
for <a href="#unix">Unix</a> above, if you want to set the umask for
applications launched via the Dock or through the GUI under Mac OS X,
you need to edit the file
/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist
(Note: If you don't have root access, you can probably do this for just
yourself by editing ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist
instead but this needs to be tested.)
<p>
Basically you need to add the following lines to the
.GlobalPreferences.plist file and then log out and back in:
<pre>
&lt;key&gt;NSUmask&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;integer&gt;63&lt;/integer&gt;
</pre>
A couple of things to note:
<ol>
<li>The value is in decimal instead of octal, hence value 63 instead
	of 077.
<li>The .GlobalPreferences.plist file might be in binary instead of
	ascii. In this case use the <i>plutil</i> utility to convert it to
			ascii, edit it and then convert it back to ascii. For example:
<pre>
% plutil -convert xml1 .GlobalPreferences.plist
% vi .GlobalPreferences.plist
% plutil -convert binary1 .GlobalPreferences.plist
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
<a name="win"><b>What about umask under Windows?</b></a>
<p>
Windows systems are typically single-user sytems and have more
complicated file permission settings. At this time there doesn't
appear to be any concerns under windows.
