<td colspan=2>
This is the GridShib-CA (version @PACKAGE_VERSION@). This software
allows you to acquire a short-lived (8 hour) Grid Credential through
your web browser and Shibboleth. After successfully authenticating, a
credential will be installed and is suitable for use with Grid Tools
such as GT4.
<p>
Note that as with all Grid credentials this GridShib CA must be
trusted by any resources you use and the identity from the Credentials
(aka the Distinguished Name or DN) must be authorized (in the
grid-mapfile).
<p>

The GridShib-CA will work for for any IdP in InQueue that will release
an identity to the the GridShib-CA. If your institution doesn't have a
IdP in InQueue (or it doesn't release your identity to us), we suggest
you register with <a href="http://www.openidp.org">OpenIdp</a>, which is
easy and known to work with the GridShib-CA.

<td colspan=2>On Unix variant systems, your umask must be set to 077 (or more
restrictive). This prevents your web browser from creating
world-readable files that would cause the GridShib CA to be insecure
on multi-user systems. <a href="faq.html#umask">More information about
