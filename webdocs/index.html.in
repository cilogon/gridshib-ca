<td colspan=2>
This is the GridShib-CA (version @PACKAGE_VERSION_STRING@). This software
allows you to acquire a short-lived (<1 day) Grid Credential through
your web browser and Shibboleth. After successfully authenticating, a
credential will be installed and is suitable for use with Grid Tools
such as GT4.
<p>
Note that as with all Grid credentials this GridShib CA must be
trusted by any resources you use and the identity from the Credentials
(aka the Distinguished Name or DN) must be authorized (in the
grid-mapfile).
<p>

<td colspan=2>
Prior to using the GridShib CA on a new system,
please <a href="checkPrerequisites.html">make sure you have the
system properly configured</a>. Failing to do so may cause you
headaches as well as being insecure.

The GridShib-CA will work for for any Institution with a Shibboleth
server in InQueue that will release an identity to the
GridShib-CA. You can find the list of institutions that are part of 
InQueue <a href="http://inqueue.internet2.edu/who/">here</a>. If your
institution doesn't have a Shibboleth Identity server in InQueue (or
it doesn't release your identity to us), we suggest you register
with <a href="http://www.openidp.org">OpenIdp</a>, which is easy and
known to work with the GridShib-CA.
