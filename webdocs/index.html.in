This is a prototype GridShib-CA that will authenticate a user using
Shibboleth, and then create and install a short-lived
Grid credential based on that authentication on the user's local system.
This credential is suitable for use with Grid Tools such as GT4.

Please note that the GridShib-CA is not a well known CA, so you will
need to install the GridShib-CA certificate to actually use generated
credentials. You can find the GridShib-CA certificate (along with the signing
policy file) here: <a href="gridshib-ca.tar">gridshib-ca.tar</a>. Please note
the GridShib-CA is not production, use of it's credentials for production
purposes is not recommended and is at your own risk.

The GridShib-CA will work for for any IdP in InQueue that will release
an identity to the the GridShib-CA. If your institution doesn't have a
IdP in InQueue (or it doesn't release your identity to us), we suggest
you register with <a href="http://www.openidp.org">OpenIdp</a>, which is
easy and known to work with the GridShib-CA.
