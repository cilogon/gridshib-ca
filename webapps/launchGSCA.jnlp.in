# This script generates the Java Web Start JNLP file containing the
# Session ID that allows the JWS application to authenticate back
# to the GridShibCA.cgi script to request a credential.
#
# This script needs to have a .jnlp extension, because otherwise
# Firefox will always ask the user what to do with the download. See:
