=head1 GridShibCA::FakeSignOn

B<DO NOT USE THIS MODULE IN A PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT.>

FakeSignOn is a implementation of the
L<GridShibCA::WebSignOn|GridShibCA::WebSignOn> module that provides a
fake web sign-on interface for use in testing the GridShib-CA when a
real signon is not available or not desired. It is intended for use in
development and testing.

This module always returns constant values which are meant to be
obviouly bogus so even if accidentially deployed in production, the
resulting credentials will not match even the most liberal access
control policies. See the documentation for the individual methods as
to what is returned.

This modules logs copious warnings to make sure you are aware it is
being used.

To use this module for testing, you need to do the following. First,
edit F<gridshib-ca.conf> and change the value of C<WebSignOn> such
that it will invoke C<GridShibCA::FakeSignOn>, i.e. the relevant line
should look like:

C<WebSignOn = GridShibCA::FakeSignOn>

Then edit F<authorizedIdps.conf> and add a line authorizing the
"FakeShib IdP" to use the GridShib CA:

C<urn:gridshib:FakeSignOn:DoNotTrust "CN=FakeUser,OU=FakeIdp,O=GridShib">

This will then allow you to run the GridShib-CA without having a web
sign-on system available. Again, B<this module is intented for testing
only>.
