    # The attachment option is required for Camino (at least) to do the
    # right thing.  However, this option seems to always cause Firefox to
    # ask what to do with the jnlp file, so we do not use it for FireFox.
    # Not that some Camino user-agent strings contain "like Firefox" hence
    # the apparently overly complex logic here.  See
    # https://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=6719
