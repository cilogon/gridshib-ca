This directory contains files for automated testing of the GridShib-CA using
the NMI Build and Test Lab (http://nmi.cs.wisc.edu/).

The first step is to request an account at
<http://nmi.cs.wisc.edu/labs/uw-madison/account-request> if you
haven't already.

To submit a test build:

  $ configure --enable-build
  $ make nmi-test

Then visit the the following URL to view the results:

Http://nmi-s003.cs.wisc.edu/nmi/index.php?page=results%2Foverview&opt_project=GridShib&rows=100

(Note, the internal B&T URLs seem to change occassionally, if the
above link doesn't work, go back to http://nmi.cs.wisc.edu/ and then
to 'Run Results' and search under Project of 'GridShib'.)

====Prereqs===

To list available prereqs, use nmi-list-prereqs. You can supply an
argument which gives the prefix of the prereqs you are interested
in. E.g.:

% nmi-list-prereqs perl
..

====Platforms===

To show all the available platforms, log onto the NMI submit node
(currently nmi-s003) and run:

% condor_status -format '%s\n' nmi_platform | sort | uniq

The following platforms are currently not included:

 x86_deb_3.1 - syslog console unwritable:
