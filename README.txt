This directory contains various files specific to the build and deployment
of the GridShib-CA client to the cilogon.org site.  After a fresh checkout
of the gridshib-ca-2.0.1 code from sourceforge.net, copy these files to the
appropriate directories and then rebuild gridshib-ca.  Some files go into
the source tree, other files can simply be copied to the
/usr/local/gridshib-ca-2.0.1 deploy directory.
